It's not indicated in the project task, what currency we're talking about, neither it's mentioned if our dataset contains info about human beings with average lifespan, but here I'm assuming so.\n",

It might be representing something completely different than number of days, like current bank account balance for instance, which is very unlikely beacuse of such a narrow range, thouht the balance could have negative values as well. Or it might be a result of some mistake, miscalculation or misprocessing of data, the data in the column does not seem to be completely random, but if it's actual meaning recovery is possible, it requires more informstion. \n",

Here I'm using astype() method with the 'int' string argument standing for integer. When converting from float to integer numbers get truncated, but digits after decimal point are not very significant for us here, and what is more important, converting floats to integers increases precision of the further calculations. Also, in my opinion, converting to integers increases human readability."
